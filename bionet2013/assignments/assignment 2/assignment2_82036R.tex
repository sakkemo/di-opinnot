{ % Start homework solution
In the second assignment, the goal was to model the same network, this time
using known promoter sequences for genes coding each of the five proteins
(proteins ASH1 and GAL80 share the same promoter sequence) and TF sequence
specificities of 4 proteins. GAL80 interacts directly with GAL4 protein, so
there is no TF sequence specificity for it. This also means that the connection
cannot be learned using the TF and promoter sequence data.

I used the TF sequence specificity as the PSWM for finding to which promoter
sequences each of the proteins is likely to bind. This, in combination with
knowing which promoter sequence is associated with which protein, can be used
to construct the network for comparison with the one given with the assignment
and in the Cell article (Cantone et. al 2009).

Examples of networks learned are shown in Figure~\ref{hyva} and Figure~\ref{huono}.

\scalefig{hyva}{0.5}{Network constructed using threshold score of 80.
Smaller scores are assumed to be insignificant.}

\scalefig{huono}{0.5}{Network constructed using threshold score of 20.
Smaller scores are assumed to be insignificant. This version of the network has
more connections than the one shown in previous figure.}

Results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:var}. Even if self-loops were introduced by the
model, they were removed before calculating the scores. It is very clear that
finding the network works well, with only slight picking up of false positives
when lowering the threshold score needed to include the connection in the
model. 
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{True positive and false positive ratios given different scores
    needed to assume a connection between two proteins.}
    \label{tab:var}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        min. score & true positive ratio & false positive ratio\\
        \midrule
  900  & 0.1667 &       0\\
  500  & 0.3333 &       0\\
  400  & 0.6667 &       0\\
  300  & 0.6667 &       0\\
  200  & 0.6667 &       0\\
  100  & 0.6667 &       0\\
   80  & 1.0000 &       0\\
   50  & 1.0000 &  0.0526\\
   20  & 1.0000 &  0.2105\\
 0.50  & 1.0000 &  0.3684\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
}

For this exercise I have also included my code for reference. The data might
be needed to read separately, though.
